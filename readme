# Proxima — the nearest horizon, the farthest freedom

## Manifesto

The internet was meant to liberate thought.  
Instead, it became a scoreboard.  
Likes, follows, trends — a cage disguised as freedom.  

**Proxima is the refusal.**

Here, thought is not reduced to numbers.  
Here, influence is measured by resonance, not vanity.  
Here, identity is chosen, not performed.

## Core Ideas

- **No likes. No follower counts.**  
  Value is not noise.  

- **Labs instead of followers.**  
  You don’t “collect” people.  
  You create a Lab — a circle of work around a theme.  
  People join Labs to think, not to worship.  

- **Reputation instead of popularity.**  
  Reputation grows when your ideas are forked,  
  your formulas are cited,  
  your arguments become foundations for others.  
  Not by farming attention, but by moving thought forward.  

- **Chronology, not manipulation.**  
  The feed is time, not an algorithmic casino.  

- **Ownership of words.**  
  Your ideas remain yours. Always.

## Why Proxima?

**Proxima Centauri** is the nearest star to us.  
Close enough to see. Too far to reach.  

We are still locked in our Solar system,  
but our minds are not.  

**Proxima is that horizon.**  
Near, unreachable, and worth moving toward.

## Roadmap

**Phase I**  
- Core posts: text, formulas, arguments.  
- Chronological feed.  
- Curated avatars (art, scientists, abstract icons).  

**Phase II**  
- Labs: communities of thought instead of followers.  
- Forks: branching ideas as dialogue, not destruction.  
- Minimalist design for pure focus.  

**Phase III**  
- Reputation system: measure of impact, not vanity.  
- Blockchain identity and ownership.  
- Optional NFT avatars and symbolic decorations.

## Closing

This is not a platform for attention.  
It is not a market for dopamine.  
It is not built for everyone.  

**It is built for minds that refuse to be counted.**
